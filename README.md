# Movie-Site
 Movie site that holds movies, has a favorites list, and adminastrator actions. 

A project from my Data Structures class with groupmates Connor Aalto, Josiah Rondon and Ava Dobro

The objective was to create a movie database for customers using Java in the command line. We needed to create a seamless interface for customers to be able to access movie records in different ways with the fastest Big O Notation.

Data structures used: BST, Priority Queue, Queue
