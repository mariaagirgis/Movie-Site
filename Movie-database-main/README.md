# Movie-database

A project from my Data Structures class with groupmates Maria Girgis, Josiah Rondon and Ava Dobro.

The objective was to create a movie database for customers using Java in the command line. We needed to create a seamless interface for customers to be able to access movie records in different ways with the fastest Big O Notation.
